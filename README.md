## Course Description

This course is designed to teach intermediate and advanced R programming techniques to students who already have experience with the basics of R. We will cover concepts to help improve the performance and management of code, provide the tools necessary to conduct quality reproducible research, and develop and release full R packages.

## Prerequisites

An introductory R course or equivalent experience is required. Students are expected to be familiar with basic R data structures, how to add and extract information from them through standard indexing techniques, reading and writing data, basic plotting, and writing and executing R functions.

## Course Outline

The first hour and a half of each class will be a review of homework and lecture. In the second half, we will have individual and group work through tutorials. For a final project, students will work in groups to create a fully functional and documented R package that is hosted on Github.

## Software

1) Students should come with the latest versions of R and RStudio installed on their laptops. They can be obtained at:
* R: https://www.r-project.org
* RStudio: https://www.rstudio.com
* Git: https://git-scm.com

2) In R, make sure you have the following packages installed (with dependencies):
* knitr
* devtools

3) Install a TeX distribution:
* Windows: MiKTeX (Complete) - http://miktex.org/2.9/setup (NOTE: Be sure to download the Complete rather than Basic installation)
* Mac OS X: TexLive 2013 (Full) - http://tug.org/mactex/ (NOTE: Download with Safari rather than Chrome _strongly_ recommended)
* Linux: Use system package manager

4) Make sure you have an account set up on GitHub (https://github.com)
